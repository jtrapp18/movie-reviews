## üöÄ Document Upload S3 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: S3-Only Implementation (Current Focus)
**Goal:** Replace temp file storage with persistent S3 storage for production deployment

**Status:** [üîÑ] In Progress

**Tasks:**
- [‚úÖ] Set up Railway MinIO service
- [‚úÖ] Create S3 client wrapper with boto3
- [‚úÖ] Update document processor to use S3 storage
- [‚úÖ] Modify API endpoints to serve from S3
- [‚úÖ] Test S3 connection and bucket creation
- [ ] Deploy and test document upload functionality
- [ ] Verify file persistence across deployments
- [ ] Test download and preview functionality

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Files persist across Railway deployments
- ‚úÖ No more temp file cleanup issues
- ‚úÖ Production-ready and reliable
- ‚úÖ Simple implementation with minimal complexity

### Phase 2: Smart Caching (Future Enhancement)
**Goal:** Add local caching layer for improved performance on frequently accessed files

**Status:** [ ] Not Started

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement local temp file caching
- [ ] Add cache TTL and invalidation logic
- [ ] Create cache cleanup on startup
- [ ] Add fallback to S3 on cache miss
- [ ] Monitor cache hit rates and performance

**When to implement:**
- High-traffic documents (same file accessed frequently)
- Large files (>50MB) causing slow S3 downloads
- Performance issues identified in production

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
# Pseudo-code for smart caching
def get_document(review_id):
    # Check local cache first
    if file_exists_in_cache(review_id):
        if cache_is_fresh(review_id):
            return serve_from_cache(review_id)
        else:
            delete_from_cache(review_id)
    
    # Download from S3 and cache
    s3_file = download_from_s3(review_id)
    cache_file_locally(review_id, s3_file)
    return serve_from_cache(review_id)
```

### Technical Details
- **Storage:** S3 object keys stored in existing `document_path` field
- **Path Structure:** `uploads/documents/{uuid}_{filename}`
- **Database:** No schema changes required
- **Frontend:** No changes needed to DocumentUpload.jsx
- **Cost:** Railway MinIO at $0.25/GB/month (predictable pricing)
